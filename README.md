## Handy Notes



## Description
For this challange I took starter code and created a note taking app that allowes users to log notes. 
The starter code included all the code I needed instead of the "server.js". I inserted the code for "server.js" and then connected it to the index.html so that it would be a functioning website for note taking.

## Usage
This application allows users to take and log notes.
When the user first enters the site they are prompted to clikc "get started" they are then taken to the "notes.html" where they are able to write a note and save it
